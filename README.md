Project Rails - Bootstrap
=========================

Project Rails Bootstrap is the Launcher for Rails server
implementation for [Minecraft](http://minecraft.net) which
is written in Java.

The actual server implementation is found here:

Status

The Bootstrap has only just begun development, and isn't
available for download yet. We hope to get the Bootstrap
and Core available soon!

We will be adding more information later on through the
development of the project!
